Blue Plague Randomizer

Some yellow doors have been removed from the early game to avoid the early fork, but you will still need to find power bombs to acquire Kraid's item.

Since the original Blue Plague has many Super Metroid items missing (But they are still residually existing in the hack), 1 random 'fun' item is added to the pool from Grapple, Space Jump, Spazer, Plasma, Speed Booster, and Screw Attack. Logic exists for these items even though they may not always appear. X-Ray was removed as a bonus option since its item fanfare was replaced by the final cutscene.
